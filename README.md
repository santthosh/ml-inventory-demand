# Inventory Demand Classification for Appointments 
**Using Machine Learning Techniques** 

![planner](images/planner.png)

## Goal

To help business owners answer **What drives demand for appointments in my business?**

Scheduling is a complex problem. Identifying the optimal schedule based on past history of customer preferences, appointments, staff availability, equipment availability, etc., is challenging.
 
By understanding the factors that drive up demand for appointments, business owners can better focus on filling up low demand slots first, then higher demand slots, optimizing for revenue and productivity. 

This is especially useful when a customer arrives to book an appointment either online or through a phone call.

Examples: Salons, Spas, Gyms, Personal Trainer, Dentists etc.,

## Q & A

* How do we source data for this project?

_We use the accompanying synthetic data generation tool to generate appointments for a fictional business. The tool can be reused to generate dataset on different time ranges__

* What techniques do we plan on using for this analysis? 

_Since this is a time series problem, we will use techniques like trend analysis, stationarity test, seasonality analysis, and outlier detection, etc., and also use different classifications techniques to label appointments_

* What are our expected results?

_Based on how easy or difficult to fill up those slots, label the available appointments as 'Low Demand' or 'High Demand'._

* Why is this project important?

_The wellness industry is [worth 4.2 trillion dollars](https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/health-wellness-industry/) especially the personal care, beauty, and anti-aging sectors are worth 1.08 trillion dollars._

_Many of these businesses in personal care like salons, spas, etc., are appointment-based businesses and have very limited capacity or help manage schedules._

_By building an ML-based solution that provides recommendations to optimize schedules, we will help millions of small businesses increase revenue and reduce drop-offs and cancellations. We will enable these businesses to spend more time with their customers than calendars._

## Methodology 

We have used an industry standard process called [CRISP-DM](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip) to analyze our datasets
